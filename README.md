# hello-world
A repository to become familiar with GitHub 

If you're reading this, then you should know: I'm you, from the future. I'm here to tell you that 
you did it! That thing you've been worried you wouldn't be able to do, you did! It went better than 
you planned, too.


In all seriousness though, I'm just here to improve my coding, and one fundamental skill that I've 
been working on improving is my touch-typing. That's the reason for the random story. Thanks!
